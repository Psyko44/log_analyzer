A vulnerability scanner tool that analyzes log files and network captures (pcap) for potential security issues such as SQL injections, XSS attacks, command injections, and more. This tool helps identify vulnerabilities in applications or network traffic logs.

## Features
- Supports scanning of log files (.log, .txt, .json) and network capture files (.pcap, .pcapng).
- Detects various types of vulnerabilities including SQL injections, XSS attempts, command injections, path traversals, CSRF attacks, and more.
- Generates JSON-formatted vulnerability reports.
- Command-line interface (CLI) based for easy integration into automated workflows.

## Installation

## Usage

      To scan a log file:

      python scan.py --scan-type log --file-path /path/to/logfile.log --output /path/to/output.json

      To scan a pcap file:
